Purpose of Experiment:

To design a hierarchy based on natural language, and then grab policies for prior experiments

Caveat:  Since we are using a NN, this means that there must be placeholders for all actions/options prior to first move.  All placeholder options will have No
policy to start with.  Once an episode has an experience that matches an option, the partial trace is reviewed.  If it is 'better' than the current policy for an option, the option
policy will be replaced.  

There may be a need to clean up the state space, as it is currently in integer variables.  NNs tend to work best with one-hot encoded state spaces if possible for enumerated items 
(like rooms or objects)



Notes:  Lamp seems to have 462 steps of life, use sparingly when possible

		These actions are cardinal because they are the only way to score points
		(technically not all direction moves score points but navigate between locations
		required to get points)

						spices, sphere, violin, portrait, bills, chalice, canary,
						grail, bar, trident, bauble, emerald, statue, pot, coffin
					
					no pts: window, trap door, lamp, sword, grate, sack, garlic
							wrench, screwdriver, bottle, eatme cake, orange cake

							match, pump, stick, buoy, shovel, wire
