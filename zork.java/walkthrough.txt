# Mainframe Zork walkthrough in 16 parts, made for the Mainframe Zork page on www.deblauweschicht.nl.

# Constructed for use with the last MDL version of the game that was published by Infocom on 22 July 1981, with occasional notes concerning the Inform implementation.

# For playing, consider for example:
# - the original MDL version with Matthew Rusotto's Confusion emulator
#   (for as near an authentic experience as one can have, without an 
#   actual PDP-10),
# - or Jeff Claar's port to C++
#   (look and feel of the original, but with the benefit of multiple and
#   named saves),
# - or Ethan Dick's implementation in Inform
#   (with modern features, such as a status line).

# ** EXTREME SPOILER ALERT **




# Mainframe Zork is a text adventure which was later developed into and commercially released as the Zork Trilogy. Veterans of the latter will recognize most elements of the earlier game as they play it, but may be surprised by some of the twists and turns. Most points are earned by collecting treasures and putting them in the trophy case.

# The thief is a problematic force in the Great Underground Empire. In some occasions he might abduct some vital items from the player, the most serious being the light source. If such an incident occurs, it might be prudent to revert to an earlier game state. Save often!

# At the same time, the thief is the only one who can open the egg. In order to convey this item to him, it is simply left in the cellar under the white house in order for him to find it. After we have dealt with him later, we can retrieve it. However, he needs time to open it. Therefore the confrontation with the thief is programmed to take place in the second half of the walkthrough. If it turns out that he still hasn't opened or even found it, postpone the confrontation.

# If -- through some mishap -- we meet our end prematurely, we may beseech the mercy of the gods by praying at the Altar.

# The following sequences are deferred to the latter part of this walkthrough, for reasons of necessity, habit, or curiosity.
#    - Dealing with the thief
#    - The bank puzzle
#    - The royal puzzle


# PART I, on the surface (egg)
# ----------------------------

# In the beginning we find ourselves in the usual location -- in front of the White House. Get egg, find way into house, and all that. The paths in the forest run a bit differently though. At the end of this section we will be ready to enter the Great Underground Empire.

# West of House

# (Note: as playing this incarnation is an excursion in computer gaming history, we might as well have a look at the leaflet in the mailbox.)

> open mailbox

# (Note: and now on with the rest of the game.)

> take lantern

> move rug

> open trap door

# Points gained: 15
# Total points : 15


# PART II, going underground (painting)
# -------------------------------------

# A short first excursion into the Great Underground Empire. We go in through the trap door and return with our first storeable treasure through a narrow chimney that leads from below to the Kitchen.

> d

# Darkness

# (Note: interesting. In Zork I the trap door is closed and barred immediately after descending. In this version however, it is still possible to climb back up as long as you haven't turned on your lamp -- but you won't get far without doing so, of course.)

# Cellar

> turn on lamp

> put down egg

> s

# West of Chasm

> s

# Gallery

> take painting

# Studio

# (Note: the chimney is of a size that restricts the number of items that the player can bring along. You may need to leave some things behind in order to climb through it.)

# Kitchen

> turn off lamp

> w

# Living Room

> open trophy case

> put painting in case

# Points gained: 36
# Total points : 51


# PART III, another way to the surface (bag of coins)
# ---------------------------------------------------

# We deal with the troll and venture into the maze for more treasure and an alternative route to the surface. If you want to map the maze yourself, take lots of stuff with you to help you mark visited rooms!

> get sword

> open trap door

# Darkness

# (Note: repeat the following action as often as is necessary, but save your game first.)

# Points gained: 15

# PART IV, the carousel (pearl necklace, spices, sphere, violin)
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# In which we restore sense to a spinning room and pick up quite a few treasures along the way. There is also a robot.

> open trap door

> d

# Darkness

> turn on lamp

# Cellar

# (Note: the trap door is not closed behind you any more.)

> e

# The Troll Room

> n

# East-West Passage

> e

# Round Room

# (Note: save your game here for the reason explained below.)
# (Note: this room spins and it has the effect of randomizing your exit direction until the spinning is stopped; you may want to go south, but you may end up to the west. In Zork II, this room makes an appearance in the same capacity, but is named the Carousel Room there.)

> s

# (Note: if you are now in a room other than the "Engravings Cave", either restore your game and try again or follow the instructions below to return to the Round Room...

> w

# Posts Room

> eat blue cake

# Tea Room

> drop orange cake

> nw

> read green paper

# (Note: the way of addressing the robot depends on the version that we are playing, and that is described on the piece of paper. We use the MDL commands here. In the inform version the proper form is "robot, <action>" rather than "tell robot, '<action>'".)

# Low Room

> tell robot 'go east'

> e

# Machine Room

> tell robot 'push triangular button'

# (Note: Inform understands "press triangular button" as well, but the MDL interpreter may be picky here.)

# (Note: this has made the circular room stop spinning.)

> tell robot 'go south'

> s

# Dingy closet

> take sphere

# (Note: this is exciting!)

> tell robot 'lift cage'

# (Note: the spherer is a so-called "palantir" (of Tolkien fame); look that up if you want to know what it does.)

> n

# Machine Room

> w

# Low Room

# (Note: the electromagnetic disturbance caused by the disabling of the motor that turned the round room causes your compass to spin. Keep trying until to get back to the Tea Room.)

# Tea Room

# PART V, some sites of religious significance (grail, platinum bar, trident)

If we would have taken the stick and then boarded the boat, we would have punctured the vessel. This can be repaired by plugging the boat with the glue in the tube that lies in the maintenance room north of the Dam Lobby, but it's a hassle.)

# PART VII, in which we open the dam (trunk of jewels, blue crystal sphere, torch)

  - If we came from the Chairman's Office, the curtain leads to a Small Room, which can be exited by going through the south wall;
  - If we came from the Small Room and go through the curtain again, we arrive in the Vault, to be exited through the north wall;
  - If we came from one of the Teller Rooms, going through the curtain leads to one of the Viewing Rooms.

# By taking the two treasures via the third route, it is possible to leave the bank unhindered.)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# We now visit a scene that is also found in Zork II. In this part we need to sacrifice our torch and return to using the lamp with its limited lifetime, so it's probably best to take care of all loose ends first before we proceed here. After this section we will tackle the end game.

  get to thief's lair?        temple
  where from altar?           forest

  hello sailor useful?        none
  value of zorkmid treasures? 30003
  Useful to do with mirror?   rub

# Parapet

# (Note: it seems that the numbers on the dial each correspond with one of eight cells situated in a ring around the fiery pit to the north. One of the cells is connected to the Treasury of Zork. By selecting a number on the dial found at the Parapet, the corresponding cell is magically (or mechanically or otherwise) moved from its original location and rotated into the slot behind the cell door to the south of the parapet. When another cell number is subsequently chosen, the previously selected cell is returned to its original location and the new placed in its stead. The cell that we want is number 4; it has a bronze door opposite side of its entrance, through which the Treasury of Zork will ultimately be accessed.)
